# AutoBirthdayWisher

Automatic birthday wisher in python that uses SMTP to send mails to others.

Replace the "<>" brackets in "main.py" with the desired information. Add the Names, emails, birth years, birth months, and birth days in the "birthdays.csv" file for all the people you might want to send the mail to. When the code is run, the mail is sent to the recievers mail IDs if the date and month matches.
The code can be set to run everyday on a website such as "pythonanywhere.com" so that the code doesnt have to be run manually everyday. Just upload the files to the website and make sure that the letter templates are in the "letter_templates" folder. then you can go to the dashboard and run "python3 main.py" and set the time you would want the code to run everyday.
